# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Service
Train a RandomForestClassifier for prediction making, save the model in a Binary file then create a REST API using Flask in a Docker container. When there is a prediction made, the Flask app responds to the prediction request with JSON, and store the timestamp, input values and prediction result in MongoDB.
